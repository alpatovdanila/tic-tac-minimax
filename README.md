Tic-tac-toe game made in process of [minimax](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorigthm experimentations.

MINIMAX with alpha-beta pruning used for AI, React used for the visual part.

Demo parameters are: 3*3 board, 3x sequence length, max minimax depth is 7

Field of any size and any winning sequence length can be set, but implementation is not optimized enough to reliably run on fields larger than 5*5;
